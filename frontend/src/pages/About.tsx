    <h1>A little bit about me</h1>
    <h2>Early Years (Childhood-College)</h2>
    <p>A curious kid who didn't like getting his hands dirty, but could spend all day doing Sudoku - Video games and computers were the logical next step. <br/>
      While I regrettably didn't build my own SaaS at the age of 15, I did get lucky with a 4-year Programming curriculum at my high school in Aurora, Colorado.<br/> 
      By the time I graduated, I had picked up the itch for programming, along with a decent understanding of Java, basic algorithms, and some mobile development.
    </p>
    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>Starting in tech consulting, I got to dip my toe in full-stack web app development in several, very different companies. <br/>
      Since mid-2024, I've switched gears to a more cloud-focused role, working day-to-day enabling developer teams and a scaling business. <br/>
      My passion for CI/CD and automation has only grown, and I'm excited to continue exploring deployment techniques, advanced orchestration tooling, and more.
    </p>
    <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
    <p>I'm still in the "soak up everything" stage of my career, and I'd like to think that never really ends. However, this website represents my own focus outside of the work days. <br/>
      I'd like to continue to build out and improve this project itself, as well as begin documenting and working on other things I find interesting at the time. <br/>
      Feel free to contact me if you have any ideas or want to collaborate on something! I'm always looking for new projects and ways to learn.
    </p>
