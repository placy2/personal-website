    <h1>A little bit about me</h1>
    <h2>Early Years (Childhood-College)</h2>
    <p>As with many programmers, I was an 'inside kid'.
      <br/>
      A high school class led me to Java and I was hooked! 
      <br/>
      I didn't launch a unicorn startup by 18 or anything,
      <br/>
      but I did get a solid foundation in programming and algorithms.
    </p>

    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>After school, I started in tech consulting.
      <br/>
        I contributed across the full stack in different web apps
      <br/>
        and learned how large-scale SDLC works in the real world.
      <br/>
      <br/>
        I became passionate about CI/CD and reliable releases.
      <br/>
        This led me to switch gears to a Cloud Engineer role.
      <br/>
        I now work day-to-day enabling developer teams and
      <br/> 
        working towards safer, faster, & simpler production releases. 
    </p>

    <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
    <p>I'm still in the "soak up everything" stage of my career.
      <br/>
       I am always happy to learn new things and work with new people.
      <br/>
       Please reach out if you'd like to collaborate or chat!
