# Test Document

This is a test document to verify the workflow handles non-meaningful changes correctly.

When this file is changed, the workflow should:
1. Run the `detect-changes` job
2. Determine no meaningful changes exist (since this file is not in frontend/, terraform/, or .github/workflows/)
3. Run the `no-changes-notification` job
4. Complete successfully with a neutral/passing result
5. Skip all build and deploy jobs
